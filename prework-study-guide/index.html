        <ul>
          <li> Git: is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project. To access Git, we use the command line. However, Git commands are not the same as the bash commands
             such as cd and mkdir that we use to navigate and create directories or perform other tasks. 
            Git commands always start with git and are used to save and track versions of your code.</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
