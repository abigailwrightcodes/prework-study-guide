        <ul>
          <li> Git: is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project. To access Git, we use the command line. However, Git commands are not the same as the bash commands
             such as cd and mkdir that we use to navigate and create directories or perform other tasks. 
            Git commands always start with git and are used to save and track versions of your code.</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>

            <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
            <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
            <li>An if statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code. 
              Just like its name sounds, when using the if statement, code will only execute if the statement 
              meets a condition, or is true.</li>
              <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically 
                used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
